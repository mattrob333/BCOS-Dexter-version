# BCOS Web UI Guide

## Quick Start - Web Interface

The easiest way to use BCOS is through the Streamlit web interface.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up API Keys

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```env
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Optional (recommended)
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your-key-here
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-key-here
```

### 3. Launch Web UI

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the BCOS web interface in your browser (usually http://localhost:8501).

## Using the Web UI

### New Analysis Tab

1. **Enter Company Information**:
   - Company Name (e.g., "Stripe")
   - Company Website (e.g., "https://stripe.com")
   - Industry (e.g., "Financial Technology")

2. **Optional: Add Context**:
   - Describe what you're looking for
   - Example: "Evaluate for Series B investment, focus on enterprise growth"

3. **Optional: List Competitors**:
   - One competitor per line
   - Example:
     ```
     Square
     Adyen
     PayPal
     ```

4. **Select Frameworks**:
   - ‚úÖ SWOT Analysis (recommended)
   - ‚úÖ Porter's Five Forces (recommended)
   - ‚¨ú PESTEL Analysis (optional)
   - ‚¨ú BCG Matrix (coming soon)

5. **Click "Run Analysis"**:
   - The system will run for 2-5 minutes
   - Progress bar shows current phase
   - Results display when complete

### Viewing Results

After analysis completes, you'll see:

1. **Summary Metrics**:
   - Company name
   - Analysis phase
   - Tasks completed
   - Status

2. **Download Options**:
   - üìÑ JSON (structured data)
   - üìù Markdown (executive report)
   - üìä PDF (coming soon)
   - üìë DOCX (coming soon)

3. **Inline Report**:
   - Executive summary
   - Phase 1 foundation
   - Phase 2 strategy
   - Recommendations

### Past Analyses Tab

- View all previous analyses
- Grouped by company
- Click "View Report" to see past results
- Each analysis has a unique session ID

### About Tab

- Learn about BCOS capabilities
- View architecture overview
- Understand use cases

## Output Organization

All analyses are saved to:

```
outputs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {company-slug}/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {session-id}/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis.json      # Full structured data
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report.md          # Executive report
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state.json         # System state
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report.pdf         # PDF report (coming soon)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ report.docx        # Word report (coming soon)
```

### Session IDs

Each analysis gets a unique 8-character session ID (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`). This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Multiple analyses of the same company don't conflict
- ‚úÖ You can compare analyses over time
- ‚úÖ Clean separation between runs

## Key Features

### Reusability

- Analyze ANY company without modifying code
- No hard-coded company names
- Each analysis is isolated
- Core system remains clean

### Session Management

- Each analysis creates a new session
- Outputs organized by company + session
- Manifest tracks all analyses
- Easy to find and compare past work

### Clean Workflow

1. **Input** ‚Üí Company URL + context
2. **Process** ‚Üí Autonomous multi-agent analysis
3. **Output** ‚Üí Reports in multiple formats
4. **View** ‚Üí Inline or download
5. **Reuse** ‚Üí Run again for any company

## Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Provide Context**: The more context you provide, the better the analysis
2. **List Competitors**: Helps with competitive intelligence
3. **Select Frameworks**: Choose frameworks relevant to your goals
4. **Review Inline**: Check the markdown report before downloading

### Multiple Companies

You can analyze multiple companies:
- Each gets its own directory
- Session IDs prevent conflicts
- Compare side-by-side using Past Analyses

### Comparing Over Time

Analyze the same company multiple times to:
- Track market changes
- See strategic evolution
- Compare before/after major events

## Troubleshooting

### Web UI Won't Start

```bash
# Make sure Streamlit is installed
pip install streamlit

# Check for port conflicts
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Analysis Fails

- Check `.env` has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Ensure company website is accessible
- Check logs in terminal for errors
- Try again with debug mode

### Can't Find Past Analyses

- Check `outputs/` directory exists
- Look for `outputs/manifest.json`
- Each company creates a slug (e.g., "stripe" from "Stripe")

## Command Line Alternative

You can still use the CLI if preferred:

```bash
# Edit config.yaml with company details
python main.py
```

But the web UI is recommended for:
- Easier input
- Better visualization
- Session management
- Download capabilities

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Output Directory

Edit `app.py` line 21:

```python
if 'session_manager' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.session_manager = SessionManager("custom/output/path")
```

### Multiple Concurrent Analyses

The web UI supports running multiple analyses:
- Open multiple browser tabs
- Each gets a unique session
- No conflicts

### API Integration

The session manager can be used programmatically:

```python
from utils.session_manager import SessionManager

sm = SessionManager()
session = sm.create_session("Stripe", "Investment analysis")
# ... run analysis ...
sm.update_session(session['session_id'], session['company_slug'], {'status': 'completed'})
```

## Next Steps

### After Your First Analysis

1. ‚úÖ Review the markdown report
2. ‚úÖ Download JSON for deeper inspection
3. ‚úÖ Compare with competitors (run analyses for them too)
4. ‚úÖ Share reports with your team

### Extend the System

- Add custom skills in `skills/`
- Integrate additional data sources
- Customize frameworks in `config.yaml`
- Build custom report formats
