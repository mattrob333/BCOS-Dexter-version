## üìä Impact

### Before Implementation:
- ‚ùå No clear path from Business Overview ‚Üí Frameworks
- ‚ùå "Next Steps" was just informational text
- ‚ùå Couldn't add frameworks to past analyses
- ‚ùå Executive summary lacked key metrics and insights
- ‚ùå Confusing user experience

### After Implementation:
- ‚úÖ Clear, intuitive framework selection UI
- ‚úÖ Actionable buttons in two locations (results page + past analyses)
- ‚úÖ Rich executive summary with metrics, positioning, insights
- ‚úÖ Detailed framework recommendations with time estimates
- ‚úÖ Seamless user experience from Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2
- ‚úÖ Flexible workflow (run now or run later)

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Framework Selector on Results Page**:
   - Run a Business Overview
   - Verify framework selector appears at bottom
   - Select frameworks and run
   - Confirm results update correctly

2. **Test Past Analyses Enhancement**:
   - Go to Past Analyses page
   - Find a Business Overview analysis
   - Click "‚ûï Frameworks"
   - Select and run frameworks
   - Verify analysis updates

3. **Test Executive Summary**:
   - Run a new Business Overview
   - Check for Key Metrics section
   - Verify Strategic Positioning appears
   - Confirm Key Insights are relevant

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Try running frameworks on analysis that already has Phase 2 (button should not appear)
   - Cancel framework selection in Past Analyses modal
   - Run frameworks with no selection (should show warning)

## üìù Notes

- Framework execution uses existing `BusinessContextOrchestrator.run_phase2()` method
- Phase 1 context is properly loaded from existing analysis
- Reports are regenerated after framework completion
- Session metadata tracks framework additions
- UI is responsive and provides clear feedback
