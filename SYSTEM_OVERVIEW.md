## 🎨 Key Innovation: Reusability & Session Management

### The Problem (Before)
- Hard-coded company names
- Outputs overwrite each other
- No historical tracking
- Can't compare analyses
- Not reusable

### The Solution (Now)

**Session-Based Architecture**:
```
Each analysis creates:
- Unique 8-char session ID (e.g., a1b2c3d4)
- Dedicated output directory
- Tracked in manifest.json
- No conflicts ever!
```

**Output Structure**:
```
outputs/
├── manifest.json                 # Tracks all sessions
├── stripe/                       # Company 1
│   ├── a1b2c3d4/                # Session 1 (Oct 22, 2024)
│   │   ├── analysis.json
│   │   ├── report.md
│   │   └── state.json
│   └── e5f6g7h8/                # Session 2 (Oct 23, 2024)
│       ├── analysis.json
│       ├── report.md
│       └── state.json
└── square/                       # Company 2
    └── i9j0k1l2/
        ├── analysis.json
        ├── report.md
        └── state.json
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Analyze ANY company without code changes
- ✅ Run multiple analyses simultaneously
- ✅ Track historical analyses
- ✅ Compare analyses over time
- ✅ Zero conflicts
- ✅ Clean separation
