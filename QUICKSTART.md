# Quick Start Guide

## For You (The Human) ðŸ‘‹

This guide will help you get this project onto GitHub and let Claude Code start building it.

## Step 1: Create Local Git Repository

```bash
cd /path/to/your/business-context-os
git init
```

## Step 2: Add All Files

```bash
git add .
```

## Step 3: Create Initial Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Business Context OS starter files

- Add README and ARCHITECTURE documentation
- Add config.yaml template
- Add main.py entry point
- Add requirements.txt
- Add .env.example for API keys
- Add CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS for Claude Code
"
```

## Step 4: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `business-context-os`
3. Description: "Autonomous McKinsey-level business research and strategy system"
4. Make it Public or Private (your choice)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/business-context-os.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 6: Let Claude Code Take Over

Now you're ready! Here's what to tell Claude Code:

### Option A: If using Claude Code CLI

```bash
cd /path/to/business-context-os
claude-code
```

Then say:
> "Please read CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md and start building this system. Begin with creating the directory structure and implementing the core orchestrator based on the Dexter patterns described in ARCHITECTURE.md."

### Option B: If using Claude.ai with Projects

1. Go to claude.ai
2. Create a new Project called "Business Context OS"
3. Add your repository to the project
4. In the chat, say:

> "I've created a new project for Business Context OS. Please read CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and the README. Then start implementing the system, beginning with the core directory structure and orchestrator."

## Step 7: Let It Build

Claude Code will:
1. âœ… Read all the documentation
2. âœ… Create the full directory structure
3. âœ… Implement the core orchestrator (based on Dexter)
4. âœ… Build Phase 1 skills (business context gathering)
5. âœ… Build Phase 2 skills (strategy frameworks)
6. âœ… Integrate data sources (Firecrawl, Exa, etc.)
7. âœ… Create report generation system
8. âœ… Test everything end-to-end

## What You'll Need

### Required
- Python 3.10+
- Anthropic API key (get at: https://console.anthropic.com)

### Optional (but recommended)
- Firecrawl API key (for website scraping)
- Exa API key (for semantic search)
- Twitter API key (for social signals)
- Crunchbase API key (for company data)

## After Claude Code Builds It

Once complete, you'll be able to:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

# 3. Edit config.yaml with your target company
# Example: Stripe, Apple, Amazon, etc.

# 4. Run the analysis
python main.py
```

And it will generate:
- Executive summary
- Business Model Canvas
- Value Chain Map
- Strategic framework analyses (SWOT, Porter's, etc.)
- Competitive intelligence reports
- Sales playbooks
- Professional presentations

All saved to `outputs/[company-name]/`

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude Code seems stuck:
- Remind it to read CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Ask it to start with just the core orchestrator
- Suggest it implement one skill at a time

### If you want to help:
- You can implement individual skills yourself
- Just follow the structure in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Claude Code can review and improve your code

## Expected Timeline

- **Hour 1**: Directory structure + core orchestrator
- **Hour 2-3**: Phase 1 skills (business context)
- **Hour 4-5**: Phase 2 skills (strategy frameworks)
- **Hour 6**: Data source integrations
- **Hour 7-8**: Report generation + testing

## Next Steps

After the system is built:

1. **Test it**: Try analyzing a company (start with a public company)
2. **Customize**: Add your own frameworks or data sources
3. **Share**: Open source it or use it internally
4. **Improve**: Add more skills, frameworks, or reports

## Questions?

If you need help:
1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md for design details
2. Check CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md for implementation guidance
3. Look at the Dexter reference code for patterns
4. Ask Claude Code for clarification

---

**You're all set! Push to GitHub and let Claude Code build it out.**

The beauty of this approach:
- âœ… You don't have to write much code
- âœ… Claude Code understands the architecture
- âœ… Everything is documented and structured
- âœ… Easy to extend and customize later

**Happy building! ðŸš€**
