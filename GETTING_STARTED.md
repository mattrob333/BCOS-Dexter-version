# Getting Started with BCOS

Welcome! This guide will help you set up and run your first business analysis with BCOS.

## What's Been Implemented

âœ… **Core System** (Production Ready):
- Multi-agent orchestrator with Dexter-inspired architecture
- Task planning, execution, and validation
- State management and context passing
- Loop detection and safety limits

âœ… **Data Sources**:
- Firecrawl client (with fallback to requests/BeautifulSoup)

âœ… **Phase 1 Skills** (Foundation Building):
- **Company Intelligence** - Scrapes website, extracts business info
- **Business Model Canvas** - Analyzes business model across 9 building blocks
- **Market Intelligence** - TAM/SAM/SOM, trends, opportunities, competitive dynamics
- **Competitor Intelligence** - Profiles competitors, positioning, threat assessment

âœ… **Phase 2 Skills** (Strategy Analysis):
- **SWOT Analysis** - Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats + TOWS matrix + prioritization
- **Porter's Five Forces** - Industry attractiveness across all 5 competitive forces

âœ… **Report Generation**:
- Professional markdown reports with executive summary
- JSON output for programmatic access
- State persistence for recovery

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your keys:

```env
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Optional (recommended for better website scraping)
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...
```

**Minimum requirement**: You only need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to get started. The system will work without Firecrawl (using fallback scraping).

### 3. Configure Your Analysis

The `config.yaml` file comes pre-configured with Stripe as an example. You can use it as-is or modify it:

```yaml
company:
  name: "Stripe"
  website: "https://stripe.com"
  industry: "Financial Technology"

goals:
  primary: "Identify growth opportunities in enterprise segment"

scope:
  phase1_depth: "comprehensive"
  phase2_frameworks:
    - "SWOT Analysis"
    - "Porter's Five Forces"

competitors:
  - "Square"
  - "Adyen"
  - "PayPal"
  - "Braintree"
```

### 4. Run Your First Analysis

```bash
python main.py
```

## What Will Happen

When you run BCOS, it will:

1. **Initialize**: Load config, set up orchestrator
2. **Phase 1 - Foundation Building**:
   - Gather company intelligence (scrape website, analyze business)
   - Build Business Model Canvas (9 building blocks)
   - Research market landscape (size, growth, trends, opportunities)
   - Profile competitors (positioning, strengths, weaknesses, threats)
3. **Phase 2 - Strategy Analysis**:
   - Conduct SWOT analysis (+ TOWS matrix and strategic implications)
   - Analyze Porter's Five Forces (industry attractiveness assessment)
4. **Generate Reports**: Create markdown report and save JSON data
5. **Save State**: Persist state for potential recovery

## Understanding the Output

After running, you'll find:

```
outputs/
â””â”€â”€ Stripe/
    â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_20241022_143022.json    # Full analysis results (JSON)
    â”œâ”€â”€ report_20241022_143022.md        # Executive report (Markdown)
    â”œâ”€â”€ state_20241022_143022.json       # State for recovery
    â””â”€â”€ logs/
        â””â”€â”€ bcos_20241022_143022.log     # Debug logs (if enabled)
```

- **Phase 1 Foundation**:
  - Company Intelligence
  - Business Model Canvas
  - Market Intelligence
  - Competitor Intelligence
- **Phase 2 Strategy**:

### Coming Soon ðŸ”œ

- More Phase 1 skills (Value Chain, Org Structure)
- More Phase 2 skills (BCG Matrix, Blue Ocean, PESTEL)
- Additional data sources (Exa, Crunchbase, News APIs)
- PDF/DOCX/PPTX report generation
- Sales intelligence & playbooks
- Automated OKR/KPI recommendations

## Testing the System

### Test 1: Basic Execution

Run with default Stripe config:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Expected**:
- System completes Phase 1 (4 tasks) and Phase 2 (2 tasks)
- Generates JSON analysis and markdown report
- Takes 2-5 minutes depending on API speed

### Test 2: Your Own Company

Edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
company:
  name: "YourCompany"
  website: "https://yourcompany.com"
  industry: "Your Industry"

competitors:
  - "Competitor1"
  - "Competitor2"
```

Run again:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Test 3: Enable Debug Logging

Edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
advanced:
  debug: true
```

This creates detailed logs in `outputs/logs/` for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'anthropic'"

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"

Create `.env` file with your API key:

```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here" > .env
```

### "Firecrawl not available"

This is just a warning. The system will use fallback scraping. To enable Firecrawl:

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
# Add FIRECRAWL_API_KEY to .env
```

### Tasks are failing validation

Check the logs (enable debug mode) to see why. Validation can be adjusted in `core/validator.py` if needed.

### Analysis seems incomplete

Check `outputs/[company]/analysis_*.json` to see:
- Which tasks completed successfully
- Any error messages in task results
- Whether fallback methods were used

## Next Steps

### Extend the System

1. **Add More Skills**:
   - Create new skill modules in `skills/phase1_foundation/` or `skills/phase2_strategy/`
   - Follow the pattern from existing skills
   - Each skill needs `__init__.py` with `execute()` function and `SKILL.md` documentation

2. **Add Data Sources**:
   - Create new clients in `data_sources/scrapers/` or `data_sources/apis/`
   - Integrate Exa for semantic search
   - Add Crunchbase for financial data
   - Connect news APIs for recent developments

3. **Enhance Reports**:
   - Add PDF generation in `reports/pdf_report.py`
   - Create PowerPoint generation in `reports/pptx_report.py`
   - Build interactive dashboards

### Customize Analysis

- **Adjust task planning**: Edit prompts in `core/planner.py`
- **Modify validation**: Change criteria in `core/validator.py`
- **Add custom skills**: Create domain-specific analysis modules
- **Configure frameworks**: Update `config.yaml` to select which frameworks to apply
